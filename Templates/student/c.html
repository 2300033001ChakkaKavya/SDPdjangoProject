                    C is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system and application development. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s and has since become one of the most important programming languages. C is known for its efficiency and is commonly used in operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.

                <h3>Key Features of C</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple and Efficient: C is easy to learn and allows efficient handling of system resources.</li>
                    <li>Portable: C programs can be run on various types of computer systems with little modification.</li>
                    <li>Structured Programming: C encourages the use of functions to divide code into logical blocks.</li>
                    <li>Low-Level Access: C provides access to low-level memory, making it suitable for system programming.</li>
                    <li>Rich Set of Operators: C supports a wide variety of operators to perform operations on data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
                <p>C syntax consists of basic elements like variables, data types, operators, and control structures. Below is a simple example of a C program:</p>

                <pre><code>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>This simple program prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.</p>
