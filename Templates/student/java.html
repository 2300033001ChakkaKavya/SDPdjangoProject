                <p class="card-text">
                    Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, particularly for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile apps, and web applications.

                <h3>Key Features of Java</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is treated as an object which makes it easier to design and manage complex applications.</li>
                    <li>Platform-Independent: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making Java programs cross-platform.</li>
                    <li>Strong Memory Management: Java handles memory allocation and garbage collection automatically, which reduces memory leaks.</li>
                    <li>Multithreaded: Java allows you to create programs that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Robust: Java includes several features that make it a robust programming language, such as exception handling and type checking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
                <p>Java syntax is similar to other programming languages like C++, and it uses braces to define blocks of code. Here is a simple Java program:</p>

                <pre><code>
/* This is a simple Java program */
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>This program prints "Hello, World!" to the screen using the <code>System.out.println()</code> method.</p>
